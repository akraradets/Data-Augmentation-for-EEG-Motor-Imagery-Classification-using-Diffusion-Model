\begin{abstract}
Motor imagery classification using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is an important research topic that has been extensively studied in the field of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). 
However, due to the limited amount of available data, the possibility of overfitting is a challenge, especially when using a deep-learning classifier. 
One way to address this is by performing data augmentation. 
This paper investigates the efficacy of the diffusion model as a data augmentation method for motor imagery classification. 
We evaluated the diffusion method by comparing it with commonly-used EEG data augmentation techniques namely such as Noise Addition, Fourier Transform Surrogates, Frequency Shift, and SmoothTimeMask. 
The result shows that the diffusion method outperformed other methods in terms of classification accuracy by 17.49\%. 
The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is used for assessing the similarity between the training set (with and without augmentation) and validation set, thus showing the effectiveness of the diffusion approach compared to other techniques.
