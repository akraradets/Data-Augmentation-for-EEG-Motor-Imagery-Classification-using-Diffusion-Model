# EEG Real-Time Classification of Motor Imagery Using Novel End-to-End Deep Learning Framework.
#Electroencephalography (EEG)  
measures electric fluctuations in the brain. One use of EEG is to measure rhythmic oscillations, which reflect synchronized activity of substantial populations of neurons. Changes in these  rhythmic  oscillations  during  cognitive  tasks  correlate  with  task conditions,  including  perceptual,  cognitive,  motor,  emotional,  and other functional processes. This renders such task monitoring tractable using  EEG  (Yannick  et  al.,  2019).

#Motor imagery (MI) 
Motor imagery electroencephalography, also known as MI-EEG, is a form of active EEG that is performed in the absence of an external stimulus (Lun et al., 2020)
It is a neural response that is produced when an individual performs a movement or imagines that they are performing the movement (Riyad et al., 2020).	
Recently, Deep learning (DL) model have been used in the development of MI-EEG.  Both feature extraction and model classification have benefited from deep learning approaches(Wu et al., 2019) and classification (Lun et al., 2020).
